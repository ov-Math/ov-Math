I mainly work with Kotlin and the most common libs, APIs and SDKs out there such as Firebase, Retrofit, Koin. Architecture-wise, I'm a fan of Clean Architecture with MVP. 😁

I also have some skills, although not so strong, in Java, Python, Elasticsearch, Javascript and Unity.

I'm interested in game developing, pixel arts, artificial intelligence, I'm always reading about these topics and I dream of making my own RPG game someday. 🤩

Besides coding I also enjoy:
- 🎧 Music
- 🎮 Games
- 🎲 RPG
- ⚡ Pokémon

Feel free to contact me for anything!~ ✌️
